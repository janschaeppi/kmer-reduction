Master's thesis, with the goal of reducing reference data for taxonomic classification.

## Project Updates
- [Sep 27 - k-mer frequencies](#sep_27)

##  <a name="sep_27"></a> K-mer frequency algorithm almost done.
The basic algorithm is done, however still has bugs in the last step. It reads
- [x] Reading FASTA files (using klib)
- [x] Syncmer Algorithm 
- [x] Hashtable construction
- [ ] Comparing sequences that landed in the same bucket.
